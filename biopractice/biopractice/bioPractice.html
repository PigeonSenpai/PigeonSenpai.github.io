    <h1>About Me!</h1>
        
    <p>I discovered my hate for coding while working on my <em>Associate Degree in Software Development.</em> I had a massive headache from my first week and vowed to never code again. I spent the second year learning pokemon min-maxing in preperation for the pain to come from this final project.</p>

    <p>For <strong>almost</strong> two years, I have focused on perfecting my problem-solving skills and playing Persona 5 at <em>The College of Western Idaho</em>. I destroyed the encryption at <em>BSU</em>and gave birth to the <em> CWI Cyber Security Team</em></p>

    <h2>Work Experience</h2>

    <p>I worked at Gamestop selling pocket monsters. <sub>I was promply fired for calling it pocket monsters.</sub></p>

    <h3>Don't Hire Me!</h3>
    <p>I will break all your code after I graduate <u>spring of 2023</u>. Contact me at <a href="mailto:cwistudent@example.com">chreiscarrico@my.cwi.edu</a> or phone <a href="tel:+1208-111-1111">(208) 111-1111</a> to discuss unemployment opportunities at your company.</p>
